                        <span class="first-letter">S</span>andra M. Gilbert, a critic, scholar, poet and co-author of
                        The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the <em>Nineteenth-Century Literary
                        </em>Imagination, a groundbreaking work of literary criticism that became a feminist classic,
                        died Nov. 10 in Berkeley, Calif. She was 87.
                        Her death, in a hospital, was caused by end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, her
                        son, Roger Gilbert, said. <i>“Is a pen a metaphorical penis?”</i> Certainly male writers thought
                        it was. And if so, wondered Ms. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, her co-author, in theirintroduction to
                        The Madwoman in the Attic, fi rst published in 1979, where did that leave women? “With what
                        organ can females generatetexts?”
                        With gusto, scholarly rigour and fl ashes of humour, the authors dug into the macho ethos that
                        had long dominated literature, casting women aseither sickly saints or unhinged shrews, and
                        female writers as intellectual lightweights – the “lady authors” and “poetesses” whom
                        NathanielHawthorne once decried as “a damned mob of scribbling women.”
                        Their breakthrough was to uncover the narrative strategies that Mary Shelley, Jane Austen,
                        Charlotte Brontë, Emily Dickinson and othersdeployed to gain literary autonomy and to protest an
                        oppressive literary patriarchy.
                        The madwomen and harridans of Brontë, Austen and others were proxies for the authors’ own rage
                        and rebellion, Ms. Gilbert and Ms. Gubardeclared. So, too, was Shelley’s Frankenstein: her
                        monster, herself.
                        “Even the most apparently conservative and decorous women writers obsessively create fi ercely
                        independent characters who seek to destroy allthe patriarchal structures which both their
                        authors and their authors’ submissive heroines seem to accept as inevitable,” Ms. Gilbert and
                        Ms.Gubar wrote. “The madwoman in literature by women is not merely, as she might be in male
                        literature, an antagonist or foil to the heroine.Rather she is usually in some sense the
                        author’s double, an image of her own anxiety and rage.”
                        The book became a feminist blockbuster, joining second-wave feminist classics such as Kate
                        Millet’s Sexual Politics (1970) and Elaine Showal-ter’s A Literature of Their Own: British Women
                        Novelists from Brontë to Lessing (1977), which traced the legacy of gender discrimination in
                        thearts.
                        “Like gnostic heretics who claim to have found the secret code that unlocks the mysteries in old
                        texts,” Le Anne Schreiber wrote in her reviewfor The New York Times, “the authors force us to
                        take a new look at the grandes dames of English literature, and the result is that they will
                        neverseem quite the same again.”

                        <p>newly minted English professors when they met in the elevator at Indiana University in 1973.
                            Ms. Gilbert was apublished poet; Ms. Gubar had just earned her doctorate. They bonded as New
                            Yorkers adrift in the Midwest. Ms. Gilbert’s specialty was 20thcentury literature, and Ms.
                            Gubar’s, the 18th century, but they decided to teach the books they had always lovedbut had
                            never studied in school: classics by women of the 19th and 20th centuries.
                            They thought of calling their course Upstairs, Downstairs, but settled on The Madwoman in
                            the Attic, in homage to the madwoman who hauntsBrontë’s Jane Eyre, otherwise known as the fi
                            rst Mrs. Rochester. The patterns that began to emerge as they taught those works – what
                            theydescribed as a distinct feminine imagination and literary tradition – were thrilling to
                            them.
                            “It felt like discovering an uncharted country,” Ms. Gubar said by phone. A few years later,
                            they took on The Norton Anthology, that staple of college freshman English. Their
                            contribution, The Norton Anthology of Lit-erature by Women, out in 1985, was a marathon
                            endeavour, a 2,457-page doorstop spanning seven centuries that reviewers praised as a
                            land-mark not just in feminism but in the study of literature.
                            Ms. Gilbert and Ms. Gubar included the work of Margery Kempe, a contemporary of Geoff ffrey
                            Chaucer’s, who wrote longingly of celibacy afterbearing 14 children – “the debt of matrimony
                            was so abominable to her that she would rather, she thought, have eaten or drunk the ooze
                            and themuck in the gutter than consent to</p>

                        <p>any fleshly communing” – as well as Kate Chopin’s novel The Awakening, pearls from Dorothy
                            Parker andselections from contemporary writers such as Alice Walker and Audre Lorde.
                            “To feminist scholars,” Laura Shapiro wrote in Newsweek magazine, “it’s been obvious for
                            years that the academic establishment would farrather spoon up the muck and ooze from the
                            gutter than redefi ne the canon of important literature to include women writers.”
                            In 1986, Ms. Magazine named Ms. Gilbert and Ms. Gubar Women of the Year.
                            The pair saw The Madwoman in the Attic as the fi rst part of a more complete cultural
                            history of women’s literature. At that point, they had yet totackle the 20th century. They
                            did so in a three-volume set, No Man’s Land: The Place of the Woman Writer in the Twentieth
                            Century, publishingthe fi nal volume in 1994. Janet Gezari, writing in The Boston Globe,
                            called it “a lively companion to the literature of the period.”
                            If you count No Man’s Land as a single work, together Ms. Gilbert and Ms. Gubar produced
                            nearly 10 signifi cant works of scholarship, give ortake, over fi ve decades. (They were the
                            Lennon and McCartney of academia, but without the breakup or the rancour.) It was a
                            collaboration con-ducted at fi rst by long-distance telephone calls and the mail, because
                            Ms. Gilbert left Indiana after two years to join the English department atthe University of
                            California, Davis. Their most recent book, Still Mad: American Women Writers and the
                            Feminist Imagination (2021), was written in the wake of Hillary

                            from Sylvia Plath and Toni Morrison to Alison Bech-del, among many others. “If the culture
                            is still changing,” they wrote in the introduction, “why are we and so many of our friends
                            still mad?”
                            They added: “Maybe if you shatter glass ceilings, you have to walk on broken glass. Maybe if
                            you lean in, you topple over.” Yet their favourite collaboration, Ms. Gubar said, was
                            Masterpiece Theatre: An Academic Melodrama (1995), a play that spoofed academia andthe
                            culture wars. It involved a stolen text, an English professor named Jane Marple who sets out
                            to rescue the text, and a motley cast of charac-ters – including William Bennett, Ronald
                            Reagan’s secretary of education; drumbeating poet and author Robert Bly; and French
                            deconstruction-ist Jacques Derrida – all corralled on a train called the Euro-Centric
                            Express. They often performed the play live at conferences.
                            The continuing culture wars were easy to poke fun at, but the play’s origins were perhaps
                            more cynical, addressing a successful strategy of theconservative playbook, as Ms. Gilbert
                            and Ms. Gubar wrote, that involved diverting “attention from the ills of society while
                            dividing and con-quering a confused public by scapegoating a small group of academics for
                            problems over which the group had little or no control.”
                            Sandra Ellen Mortola was born on Dec. 27, 1936, in New York. Her mother, Angela (Caruso)

                    <p>civil engineer.
                        Sandra grew up in Jackson Heights, in New York’s Queens borough, and attended Hunter College
                        High School, in the Manhattan borough. Sheearned her bachelor’s degree in English literature
                        from Cornell University, where she met Elliot Gilbert, then a doctoral student; they married
                        in1957. After a year in Germany, where her husband served in the Army, the couple returned to
                        New York. There, she earned a master’s degreefrom New York University and a doctorate from
                        Columbia University, both in English literature.
                        Ms. Gilbert retired from UC Davis in 2005 as a distinguished professor emerita. In 2012, she and
                        Ms. Gubar won the National Book Critics Circlelifetime achievement award.
                        “People forget that, when they were writing, even to talk about women writers as having anything
                        in common, as having a story of their own, asbeing connected in any way to each other, was
                        incredibly controversial,” Katha Pollitt, a feminist author, told The Washington Post in
                        2013.“Now it seems completely obvious.”
                        In addition to her son, Ms. Gilbert leaves her daughters, Katherine Gilbert-O’Neil and Susanna
                        Gilbert; four grandchildren; and her partner, DickFrieden. Elliot Gilbert died in 1991, at 60,
                        during what had been billed as a routine procedure: surgery to remove a cancerous prostate
                        gland.
                        Ms. Gilbert set out to investigate the cause of his death, which was not a heart attack, as the
                        surgeon told her, but from bleeding out in the recov-ery room, an outcome a simple blood test
                        would have prevented. Wrongful Death: A Medical Tragedy (1995) is her memoir of that
                        experience,her attempt to sue for malpractice and her catastrophic grief.
                        “How would one calculate a sum to replace the dead person?” she wrote. “Would some jury decide
                        on, say, $100,000 for his hands, $50,000 forhis beard and his thick, dark eyebrows, $75,000 for
                        his hazel eyes?” The case was settled for an undisclosed amount. Ms. Gilbert was the author of
                        eight books of poetry; her most recent, Judgment Day, was published in 2018. Aftermath (2011),
                        her penultimatebook of poetry, is largely a collection about grief and loss – her partner after
                        Elliot Gilbert, mathematician David Gale, died in 2008 – leavenedwith a clutch of sardonic
                        verses addressing her decaying older self, including Tooth Implant Sonnet.
                        “Sandra brought poetry to our collaboration,” Ms. Gubar said. “She never pontifi cated, either
                        as a critic or a poet or a teacher or a feminist. Itwas just not in her nature. Instead, she
                        would draw upon lyricism and a visceral response to literature to articulate the fears and hopes
                        of hergeneration.”</p>
